# Fame To Blame
CODING WEEKS 2021-2022


Fame to Blame is a python program to collect tweets about celebrities chosen by the user and to analyze them by detecting whether they are offensive or not. The user is then able to see a ranking of the celebrities he submitted ordered by the frequency of tweets insulting them. This is a project taking part in the second week of the CentraleSupélec Coding Weeks
